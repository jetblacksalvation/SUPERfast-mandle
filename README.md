# SUPERfast-mandle
This program is a decently fast Mandelbrot program. I will eventually add Multithreading.

All it does is iterate through the screen's pixels, passes the pixel location to the mandlebrot set. I divide that value by scale and 800, 
because i believe the mandelbrot set wants values between 1?
